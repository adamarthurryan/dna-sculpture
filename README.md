=============

An tool/toy for exploring a certain class of geometric entities: for a given angle alpha, sequences of regular polygons joined at an edge with dihedral angle alpha. The entities in this class are geometrically complex, but are simply specified by a string of data: the sequence of polygons and the edge connections between them. This software was part of an art project exploring the relationship between information, image and form.

A book was produced with images from this software. See: http://madanworb.com/blog/2013/05/01/possible-forms-book-1/

The software was written for the Processing platform and API.

There are interactive tools for changing display perameters, editing sequences, loading and saving, rendering to disk, etc. Also includes some simple shaders for rendering fog, wireframes, etc.
